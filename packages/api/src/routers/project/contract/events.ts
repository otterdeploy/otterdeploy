/**
 * Live project event stream — push-side replacement for `useLiveQuery`
 * polling on the resource/deployments/logs pages.
 *
 * The server subscribes to the docker event bus, filters events to the
 * caller's project (via the `otterdeploy.project` label on the underlying
 * service), and yields one slim event per change. Frontend consumers
 * react by invalidating the queries that own the affected data — the
 * actual data fetches still go through the existing oRPC endpoints, so
 * payloads don't pass through this channel.
 *
 * The event shape is intentionally tiny: a verb + which thing changed.
 * Anything that needs more context comes from a follow-up read query —
 * keeps the push channel cheap to maintain and easy to reason about.
